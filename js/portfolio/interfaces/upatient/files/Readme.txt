 CrossOver UI/UX Designer Application Documentation
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 - Wholeover project is listed with the documents under the folder UIUX_Designer under the folder CrossOver with the provided link served on Dropbox. The main designs are in the "Files folder".
 
 - Besides extra little details provided whereever applicable within the questions, there is more architectural patterns and matter of interest explained. There is prototype of the project directly under the served file. And under the files folder there are all necessary products created during the whole design and development process.

- As well as all visual designs are within the documents, please directly contact me either on interview or in a given short time to complete. Eventhough many other enhancements could be applied to get more powerful demos, I found this way more idealistic to create the resulted product with the ease of its simplicity and as the person developing the product's itself precisely.

- Here I used frontend stack to display the ease of the prototype or more accuretly product's itself even backgrounded. This makes frontend developers to tackle more safely with the framework (s)he want to use and even considering backend stack to deal with.

- There is also an extra package.json file in this case created for future production needs to deploy on the development scene even it's handled with scripts in this case and no need to get an extra explanation with ingredents.

- I prefered Bootstrap framework with the prototype for it's ease and I created it to look wireframe-like to show the modularity and pixel perfect design easy-to-understand as a frame with boundaries. So it's intentionally not colored and/or the components exactly styled since the frontend product under the frontend folder colorized and styled just how the final output should look like as desired.

- I like to make my designs on 15" screen but in this case I couldn't have time to even test it for its adaptivity and there are lots of things to consider like hiding some visuals for the smaller screens to be able to get perfect responsivity and making compatible for the mainstream browsers. There are a couple of issues also I couldn't apply to my prototype and frontend product either because of not being able to configure/work or it takes time to find & implement perfect element for that need (like more stylist arrows could have choosen for the table, more appropriate/simpler CSS solutions could be applied for some situations, and there are lots of features to add which takes time each (testing the UX and frontend code as well).

- Some images I used derived from the snap of your UI asked me as a challange. Like a shapes of the diet ingridents could be added inside the table which already colored and I believe I tried to make the rest understandable and of course still there are points I'll try to explain if possible face-to-face about the development process.

- Since look and the touch of the interface is important, I used simply white background to create a differentiation for the fonts, icons, links and the borders. As a main theme color (with the header, footer and active line-outs) I used Materialize framework's light-blue as I inspired as an health/dietation familiar feel and matching with the UPatient's own logo which is darker blue (a grey filtered or shaded version of logo could be much more better). I tried another color for the main theme #ee6e73 as medics and healthcare firms mostly prefer but that time the logo has to change so preferred common way in this case.

-  Footer I think was a bit thinner but the sponsor images doesn't fit with current sizes and can be tried a bit more to reshape. Footer-copyright size should be the same as header height and even the shade can be tried as having singler color as the same with header. The menu attached to the footer is for search, info, settings and some others as help and form submission will likely to be initiated as understood from the image provided. I either prefer the "hamburger menu" located at the upper left corner but in this case there is "side panel menu" covering most of the area where menu is open. So that to avoid the confliction, a simpler and material design menu located with the footer and the brand located at the upper left corner. The menu at the footer with it's subcolors shoul be worked for alternatives.

- After developing frontend with the framework's table it looked like a bit more bigger than I think about the overall look but it's negotiable to make it scrollable or not so that I didn't change back later.

- And the same with the side navigation bar, I was going to show it under the footer but looked like different and it can be presented as wish.



PS: Thanks for letting me enjoy this and sorry it's a bit long because I'm having terrible days and I didn't want it to last longer so that I couldn't revise again.
